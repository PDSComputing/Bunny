# Bunny

Document the code using comments to explain what is happening in the code thus far.  Commenting as you go, complete the bunny model, creating the body parts that are as yet unfinished.  If you would like to start from scratch, save a copy of the SCAD file, comment the original, and create your novel, well commented bunny in the copy of the code.  Upload any and all files you create to this repository, but do not commit to the master branch.  Instead, create a patch with your name as a title for the patch.
